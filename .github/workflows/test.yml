            ✅ **17 tests passed** - Critical parsing logic validated

            **Tests cover:**
            - Gallery album and photo parsing (cheerio selectors)
            - Event date/time/location extraction (regex patterns)
            - News article parsing
            - HTML sanitization and error handling
            - URL normalization

            **Phase 1 Goal:** Validate critical parsing patterns without network dependencies
            **Phase 2 Goal:** Export scraper functions and add integration tests for 50% coverage
